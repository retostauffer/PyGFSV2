[main]

# Reforecast version to be downloaded. This package was originally
# written to process GFS reforecasts version 2 which has been
# deprecated in September 2020. Thus, the package has now be
# adjusted to also allow downloading GFS reforecast version 12.
# The defaultconfig now specifies version = 12, however, in case
# you are using an old (existing) config file which does not contain
# a version specification it should fall back to version 2.
# If you want to download version 2 data, you can always set 'version = 2'.
#version = 12

# Where to store the files
outfile = data/%Y/%m/GFSV<version>_%Y%m%d%H_<param>_<type>.grib2

# PLEASE NOTE: this is the default config file wherefore several
# settings are not set. If you create your own config file you can
# specify several things like date range (from/to), only downloading
# a specific month within this time range (only), a setep subset
# which should be downloaded (steps), and an areal subset given by
# lonmin/lonmax/latmin/latmax (uses wgrib2 subsetting).
 
# Date range for which the forecasts should be downloaded.
# Have to be in format YYYY-mm-dd.
from = 2017-07-01
to   = 2017-07-01

## Integer. If set it has to be 1-12. If set to "1" (month 1)
## only January forecasts will be downloaded within the range
## "from" "to" specified above.
#only = 7

## The forecast steps which have to be downloaded. List of integers.
steps = 6,9

## For subsetting after downloading (requires wgrib2)
#lonmin = 5
#lonmax = 17
#latmin = 45
#latmax = 54

# FTP specifications; used for downloading GFS reforecast version 2.

[ftp]

# %Y/%m/%d/%H will be replaced by the date specified.
# <type> will be replaced by the type, e.g,. c00 for control run

#        mean and sprd.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# The [data xxx] blocks define what to download. 'xxx' here represents
# a parameter (or variable).
# The variable information of the GFSv2 can be found here:
# - https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/forecasts/reforecast2/README.GEFS_Reforecast2.pdf
# Last accessed: 2017-08-05, Reto.
#
# Each of these blocks has two options. 'members' is required,
# 'levels' optional and only for pressure level data. Two examples:
#
#     [data cape_sfc]
#     members = TRUE
#
# ... will download surface cape, member by member (control run and
# the ten ensemble members of the GFS reforecast v2).
#
#     [data tmp_pres]
#     members = FALSE
#     levels  = 850,700,500
#
# ... will download temperature on pressure levels, mean and spread
# only for the three levels 850/700/500 millibars or hectopascal.
# 
# NOTE: this is the default config file. The default config file
# has no data/variable definition at all. However, if you create
# a personal config file you can specify them as shown below
# (simply uncomment some of the blocks or deifne your own).
