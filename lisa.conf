# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# The [data xxx] blocks define what to download. 'xxx' here represents
# a parameter (or variable).
# The variable information of the GFSv2 can be found here:
# - https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/forecasts/reforecast2/README.GEFS_Reforecast2.pdf
# Last accessed: 2017-08-05, Reto.
#
# Each of these blocks has two options. 'members' is required,
# 'levels' optional and only for pressure level data. Two examples:
#
#     [data cape_sfc]
#     members = TRUE
#
# ... will download surface cape, member by member (control run and
# the ten ensemble members of the GFS reforecast v2).
#
#     [data tmp_pres]
#     members = FALSE
#     levels  = 850,700,500
#
# ... will download temperature on pressure levels, mean and spread
# only for the three levels 850/700/500 millibars or hectopascal.
# 
# NOTE: this is the default config file. The default config file
# has no data/variable definition at all. However, if you create
# a personal config file you can specify them as shown below
# (simply uncomment some of the blocks or deifne your own).
